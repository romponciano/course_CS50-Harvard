0.  JPEG: 24 bit, or 16.8 million;
    GIF: maximum of 256 colors (8 bits);
    PNG: 24 bit, or 16.8 million;
    BMP: 32 bit color, or over 4 billion;
        
1.  Only GIF.
        
2.  The higher the compression of an image file, the worse its 
    quality. Because each compression, the file reduces the color 
    variation used so loses image quality.
    An image with less compression will have a better quality than 
    an image with higher compression.
        
3.  JPEG.
        
4.  If a file is deleted on the FAT file system the first character of a 
    file name in the directory entry is replaced by a special character 
    causing the operating system (Windows, DOS etc.) to ignore the file. 
    Also, all clusters allocated to the file are marked as 'available' 
    in the File Allocation Table (FAT for short).
    
5.  Delete files and overwrite the section on disc with zeroes.
    
6.  It's a header file with "new" types of integer.
    
7.  We used to declare a specific data wide. Like uint_8t: an integer 
    with 8 bits.
    
8.  WORD: 2 bytes
    BYTE: 1 byte
    LONG: 4 bytes
    DWORD: 4 bytes
    
9.  The 2 bytes is for for header file (file type).
    The header field used to identify the BMP & DIB file is 0x42 0x4D in 
    hexadecimal.

10. bfSize is for the size of the bitmap file and biSize is the size of 
	the structure

11. biHeight negative means the bitmap is a TOP-DOWN DIB and it's origin 
    is the UPPER left corner.

12. It specifies the number of colors and the bits of each pixel.

13. Because fopen cannot create the outfile to write, with copy.c:37.

14. Because the program is reading 1 RGB triple at a time.

15. 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel = 9 bytes. 
    +3 bytes = 12 bytes (multiple of 4)

16. Skip over padding (if any, so looks for the next pixel)

17. It's an integer constant used as argument to fseek function.

18. Milo Banana dun it.
