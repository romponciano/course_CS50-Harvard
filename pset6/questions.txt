0.  The longest words in the English language. (LOL)

1.  getrusage returns resource usage 
    statistics for the calling process measures in the 
    "before" struct.
    
2.  16 sets of data.

3.  With the getrusage(), you can get the reference point 
    before and after the fuction run, which can filter out the 
    unrelevent resource usage outside the process.
    
4.  When fgetc() returns digit, the loop will consider it as
    not word, then use while loop to skip the character until
    the function return a space.
    It will be consider the end of a words, when the loops
    reads a space.
    
5.  fscanf() might ends up with a string contains other 
    signs, the result might not be listed in the dictionary 
    for spelling check.
    
6.  The word for check and the dictionary for reference shall 
    be consistant during the spell checking process, it would 
    be safer to declare the arguments as const.
